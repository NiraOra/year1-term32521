## First Lesson
 
### General stuff
#

- warm welcome ? I suppose
- Core of code is algorithms
- course email: cs2521@cse.unsw.edu.au
- ed forum is preferred for questions

### 1511 vs 2521
#
- you start thinking like a computer scientist (look at problem, data needed, how to store it)
- what combination
- analyse behaviour/correctness

### Pre conditions (pre-requisite knowledge)
#
- produce a correct C program
- understand state-based model of computation
- use fundamental C data structures (char, int, float, etc)
- use fundamental control structures (if, while)
- implement abstraction via function declarations, ADTs
- fix simple bugs in incorrect programs
- structs, pointers, malloc, linked lists

### Post conditions
#
- analyse performance characteristics
- measure performance behaviour
- choose/develop effective data structures
- package a set of DS+A as an abstract
- etc.

### Major themes
#
- analyse correctness !!!!


### Schedule per week
#
- 4 hours per week
- lectures contain
  - summary of content
  - problem solving exercises
 ```
example code 
 ``` 

### Tutes and labs
#
- run from week 1 to 10
- exercises for week x available in week x - 1
- similar to comp1511
